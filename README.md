### 1. Overview of NLP

- How machines understand and reply to human language.
- Branches of NLP:
  - **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
  - **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**

### 2. Key Terminology

- **Tokenization** â€“ Breaking sentences into individual words or tokens.
- **Stemming** â€“ Reducing words to their root form (e.g., playing â†’ play).
- **Lemmatization** â€“ Similar to stemming but returns the correct root word.
- **POS Tagging** â€“ Identifying parts of speech (noun, verb, etc.).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** â€“ Recognizing entities like names, organizations.
- **Chunking** â€“ Grouping tokens into meaningful phrases.

### 3. NLTK Toolkit

- A popular Python library for NLP.
- Includes tools for tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and more.

### 4. Installing NLTK

```bash
pip install nltk
```
